# Care_Core

My older brother lives at this nursing facility named above. I've never been there myself, but my sister and other brother
has. now, what my family has told me about this place is bad. He has to share a bathroom with another room, as well as the
staff. His shower is communal and it has black mold in it and is never cleaned. Even a friend went there and said it was discusting and is trying to get him moved out.
This Care Core needs closed down.
